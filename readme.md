## IDEA Encryption Algorithm
```bash
International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a once-proprietary free and open block cipher that was
once intended to replace Data Encryption Standard (DES). Once called Improved Proposed Encryption 
Standard (IPES)IDEA is a minor revision to the Proposed Encryption Standard (PES).
IDEA uses similar processes for encryption and decryption, with some inverted ordering of round keys. It 
consists of a series of 8 rounds and operates on 64-bit blocks using a 128-bit key. IDEA suffered
from weak keys until its key schedule was revised, and it may call for further revision in the future. 
IDEA has been and is optionally available for use with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).  
IDEA has been succeeded by the IDEA NXT algorithm, itself once known as FOX.
